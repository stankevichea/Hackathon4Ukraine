# UNDERSTANDING THE USER

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">The refugees are struggling with emotional and mental health problems caused due to the war situation\.</span>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">The refugees do not speak Polish language thus it makes it even harder for them to </span>  <span style="color:#FFFFFF">reach out</span>  <span style="color:#FFFFFF"> for help\.</span>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">The refugees are concerned about their age while seeking help</span>
