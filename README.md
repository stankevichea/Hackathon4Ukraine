This repo was created during the [Hackathon4Ukraine](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackathon4ukraine-tickets-293387910137?keep_tld=1). 

## [Frontend on Netlify](https://determined-booth-c58f9d.netlify.app/)
## [Figma UX draft](https://www.figma.com/file/xdWMsBGT1GOHQVgLNdTmnp/prepkit.help?node-id=0%3A1)
## Goal

The goal is to create a public website aggregating information for Ukrainian refugees:

> There is a large number of businesses and government organizations currently
offering free or discounted services for Ukrainians. Provide a way to dynamically
gather information about these services and what they have to offer, as well as
present them in a way that would be easy to read and access.
