# UA Damage Map

We have created a fully functional website \(also suitable for use with a telephone\) that allows you to report damage degree and thus also determines whether both public buildings and apartment blocks are working\. The purpose of the app is to enable residents to spread information quickly and efficiently\. You don't know if the nearby post office or hospital is working? Check it out in our app\!
